# Overview of the Project
MATLAB codes to open serial communication with a ball and pipe system. The system is made of a vertical cylinder with a ping pong ball controlled by a fan on the bottom and height measured by a time of flight sensor on top. The objective is to balance the ball at a target altitude. 


# Theory of Control Method
Control Method chosen was the **Q-Learning** which is a type of reinforcement learning. The 'Q' in Q-Learning stands for quality. The goal of Q-Learning is to maximuze the value of Q by using a Q-table to find the best solution.
